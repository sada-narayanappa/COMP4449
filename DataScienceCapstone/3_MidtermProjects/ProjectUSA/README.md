# Violent Crime Rates by US State
The goal of this project is to identify hierarchies of clusters of US states according to violent crime rates data. 
Data from [ETHZ](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/USArrests.html). Please, work over this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/emmanueliarussi/DataScienceCapstone/blob/master/3_MidtermProjects/ProjectUSA/main.ipynb).
