# Predicting IMDB Rating for Movies
The goal of this project is to build a model that predicts the IMDB rating score based on attributes as duration, actors or even titles. 
Data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset). Please, work over this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/emmanueliarussi/DataScienceCapstone/blob/master/3_MidtermProjects/ProjectIMDB/main.ipynb).
