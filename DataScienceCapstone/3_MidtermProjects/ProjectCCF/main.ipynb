    "# Detecting Credit Card Fraud\n",
    "It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions. The goal of this project is to build a model able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions. More info [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)."
