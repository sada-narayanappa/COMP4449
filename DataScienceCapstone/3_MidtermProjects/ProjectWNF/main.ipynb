    "# Wine Reviews\n",
    "The goal of this project is to regress wine prices from atributes like country, region, and points on [wineenthusiast](https://www.wineenthusiast.com/). You are provided with almost 300K reviews scraped from WineEnthusiast during June and November 2017. Think about some interesting questions you could answer with this data: which wines are most positively reviewed? does this positivity correlates with its price? More info about this data set [here](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews). "
