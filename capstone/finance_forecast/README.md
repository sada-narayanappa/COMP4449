# Leveraging Feature Engineering for Enhanced Stock Market Price Prediction

## Background

The objective of this project is to harness the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance stock market price prediction accuracy through feature engineering. The project aims to analyze two years' worth of week-ending prices for all tradable securities and ETFs (Exchange Traded Fund) (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp) to identify securities with a strong correlation to a specific target stock price of your choice. 

** The primary goal is to discover potential leading indicators for future stock price prediction. **

### Project Objectives:

1. ** Data Collection ** : Gather historical stock price data for a wide range of tradable securities and ETFs, including weekly
closing prices for two years. This data will be provided.

2. ** Feature Engineering **: Implement advanced feature engineering techniques to extract meaningful features from the collected
data. This includes time-based features (e.g., moving averages, volatility measures), and any other relevant indicators
that may influence stock prices.

3. ** Correlation Analysis **: Calculate the correlation between the target stock's price movements and the selected features.
Identify securities and ETFs that exhibit a strong correlation with the target stock's price fluctuations. This step may
involve statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms.

4. ** Model Building**: Develop machine learning models, such as regression models, time series forecasting models, or deep
learning models, to predict the target stock's future prices based on the selected leading indicators (securities and
ETFs). Evaluate and fine-tune these models to optimize prediction accuracy.

5. ** Backtesting and Validation **: Backtest the models using historical data to assess their predictive performance. Utilize
metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to quantify
prediction accuracy.

6. ** Visualization and Interpretation **: Create visualizations and dashboards to present the results effectively. Interpret the
findings and provide insights into which securities and ETFs are strong leading indicators for the target stock.

7. ** Report and Documentation **: Prepare a report documenting the entire project, including data sources, preprocessing steps,
feature engineering techniques, model architectures, results, and conclusions. Share insights on the potential practical
implications of the project's findings.

8. ** Presentation ** : Deliver a compelling presentation summarizing the project's goals, methodologies, findings, and
recommendations.
